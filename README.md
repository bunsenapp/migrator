# migrator

Migrator is a simple tool to aid the migration of databases. Inspired by how the
folks over at StackOverflow manage migrations, you don't need to write any code
for this, simply add your SQL scripts into a directory, configure Migrator 
and run the executable. 

Migrator has the following features:

* Migration tracking, either in the database or externally.
* Configurable, flexible structure.
* Write your database migrations using the language you're supposed to: SQL.
